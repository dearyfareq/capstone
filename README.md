1-for the capstone project of our bootcamp, I made a portfolio Webpage using react, it made it easier to make components </br>
2-no frameworks or any of the such were used, all the code and the media Q were done manually for the sake of setting this information in stone/brain
3-I would like to notify you that the Capstone project has been "FINISHED", I say it like that because I still don't have your feedback and there is surely room for improvement

Notes on the project:
-a react based portfolio
-made with several components
-every step was documented on a git repo
-it involved making my own assets
-mainly JSX and CSS files
-swiperJs and emailJs were used
-deployed on netlify
-made to search and Google alot( alot of problems, A LOT, came while coding it)
-JS functions were used
-an email supported form was made using emailJS
-it owe the credits to both you and all the other channels that helped me
